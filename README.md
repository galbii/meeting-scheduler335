Algorithm Engineering Project

*****Project Description:

Installation:

After cloning the repository, you can run the main.py file with

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This will prompt you for some inputs for a person's schedule and clock in/clock out time.
The test sample cases can be found within the Inputs.txt file, but you are free to use any input of the same format you would like.

Usage:

Inputs are manually inputed into the program or enter "q"/"Q" to quit. The output of the directed input is copied to the file "Output.txt". For ease convenience, the output will be printed to the console as well.
